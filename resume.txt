I am a computer applications graduate with a strong interest in software development.

I have experience working with C++ and object oriented programming concepts.
I regularly use C++ to build small programs and practice problem solving.

I am familiar with data structures and basic algorithms.
I have practiced arrays, strings, and logical problem solving.

I also have working knowledge of Python and have used it for small scripting tasks.
I understand basic backend concepts and server-side logic.
I have worked with databases at a basic level and understand how data is stored and queried.
I am eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills through real-world projects.
